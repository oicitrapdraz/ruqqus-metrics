          <p>I made this site to follow up on Ruqqus' statistics. I was partly inspired by <a href='https://frontpagemetrics.com'>frontpagemetrics.com</a> and <a href='https://subredditstats.com'>subredditstats.com</a>.</p>

          <br />

          <h4>How can you help?</h4>

          <br />

          <p>There are many ways you can help me and be part of this project!</p>

          <br />

          <h5>1. Visibility</h5>

          <p>For example, if you are a Guild mod you can leave in its description a link to the metrics of your Guild. Take <a href='https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusMetrics'>RuqqusMetrics</a> Guild as an example, where I put a link to <a href='https://ruqqus-metrics.com/guilds/RuqqusMetrics'>ruqqus-metrics.com/guilds/RuqqusMetrics</a>. Or simply share this web app to make it more known.</p>

          <br />

          <h5>2. Maintenance Costs</h5>

          <p>Currently, the total cost of this web app is approximately $90 USD / year. The most effective way to help me is to donate to my BTC wallet 174QFATJQvN1KHGuiGD5sNBLCj1VYjh7H9 or <a href='https://www.paypal.me/patriciosard'>Paypal</a> but only do it if you don't mind sparing a couple of dollars.</p>
          <p>If you are a web developer and would like to use DigitalOcean (currently this web application is being hosted there) use my <a href='https://m.do.co/c/efa11f7d69a0'>referral link</a> so I can get credits to maintain my web app.</p>

          <br />

          <h5>3. Codebase and Feedback</h5>

          <p>If you are a web developer and know some Ruby/Rails you can directly contribute to the application codebase making a pull request to the <a href='https://github.com/oicitrapdraz/ruqqus-metrics'>GitHub repository</a>. You can also create threads <a href='https://ruqqus.com/+RuqqusMetrics'>here</a> or issues in the <a href='https://github.com/oicitrapdraz/ruqqus-metrics'>GitHub repository</a>. Even grammar corrections are welcome.</p>

          <br />

          <p>Finally, if you notice that a Guild is missing, you can use the form I created for these cases <%= link_to 'here', new_guild_path %>, Thank you very much for your attention and any help you could have given me to improve this app.</p>

          <p>Regards.</p>
